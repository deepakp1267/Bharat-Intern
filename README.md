# Bharat-Intern
Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Prediction using LSTM

* Introduction
This project is a part of my internship task in the domain of Data Science at Bharat Intern. The task involves predicting the stock prices of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Stock prediction is a challenging task due to its inherent volatility and complex nature. However, with the advancements in deep learning techniques, LSTM models have shown promising results in capturing the temporal dependencies and patterns in time series data, making them suitable for stock price prediction.

* Project Overview
In this project, I have developed an LSTM-based model to forecast the future stock prices of Microsoft Corporation. The project utilizes historical stock price data of MSFT and trains an LSTM model to learn from the patterns and trends present in the data. The objective is to build a reliable predictive model that can assist in making informed investment decisions.

* Repository Contents
The repository contains the following files:

* README.md: This file provides an overview of the project and its components.
  
Microsoft_Stock_Prediction.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction using LSTM.
data: This folder contains the historical stock price data in CSV format, which is used for training and testing the LSTM model.
models: This folder stores the trained LSTM model in HDF5 format for future use.
results: This folder contains the predicted stock prices and evaluation metrics generated by the model.

* Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies:

Python 3.7 or above
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
TensorFlow
Keras
Matplotlib
Please ensure that these dependencies are installed before running the Jupyter Notebook.

* Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip or conda.
Open the Jupyter Notebook Microsoft_Stock_Prediction.ipynb in your preferred Python environment.
Execute the code cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the LSTM model, and make predictions.
The predicted stock prices and evaluation metrics will be saved in the results folder.
You can also explore the trained model in the models folder and use it for future predictions.
Results and Evaluation
The model's performance can be evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of the stock price predictions.

In the Jupyter Notebook, I have included a section to evaluate the model's performance on the test data and visualize the predicted stock prices against the actual values.

* Conclusion
By leveraging LSTM neural networks, this project demonstrates the potential of deep learning techniques in predicting stock prices. However, it is important to note that stock market prediction is a complex and uncertain task, and the accuracy of the predictions may vary. It is always advisable to use predictions as a reference and perform additional analysis before making any financial decisions.

This project has provided valuable insights into the stock prediction domain, allowing me to apply my knowledge and skills in data science. I am grateful to Bharat Intern for providing this internship opportunity and allowing me to work on such an engaging task.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different models, and provide feedback for improvements.
